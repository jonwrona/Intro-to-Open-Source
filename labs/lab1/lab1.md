##Reflection

I would like to continue a personal project of mine called *Table Tome*. Recently, the developers of the game (Wizards of the Coast) released the OGL (Open Game License) for 5th edition, which now permits me to include game content in *Table Tome*. This will allow me to complete the project to the point that I had hoped to when I thought of the idea. In returning to working on this project, I hope to go back and improve current code, as well as add more features.
