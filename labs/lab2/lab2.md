### Importance of Choosing a License

If you do not choose a license that is certified by the OSI, then your project can not be considered open source and it is in fact all rights reserved. If you want your project to be open source it is very important that you choose a license, otherwise people who may have an interest in contributing to your project or using it, will be scared away from doing so due to the lack of a license.

Choosing between the different flavors of Open Source licenses is also very important. If you choose the "wrong" license for your project, it may allow people to do things using your work that you would prefer not to allow.

### Never Use a Project that Doesn't Have a License

Using a project that doesn't have a license is very risky for one of the reasons listed above as being important for choosing a license. If you use a project without actively finding a license on it, that project may be all rights reserved, in which case you do not have permission to use that project, which may result in being sued.

### Why the Web beat Gopher

Yes, I agree with this claim. The part of this section that I grabbed onto was the statement that Gopher refused to allow the public to make any decisions for the project early on via contributing. I disagree with this decision because you can include the public without using all of their ideas. Although looking through additional code may seem like a waste of time, having more minds dedicated to the improvement of a project is more often than not beneficial to the growth of the project.

### License Justification for the Android Kernel

In my opnion, Google probably chose the GPL v2 as the Open Source license for the Android kernel because it is a copyleft license. This means that any improvements that individuals outside of Google make must be made public with the same license, and Google can include those changes in the kernel if they choose to do so. This will benefit projects that fork the kernel because they will have those improvements built in already, as well as the kernel itself.

### License for an Example Project

My example project is Table Tome, a personal project of mine. I chose the GPL because it is a copyleft license. I did this because I want any changes that are made to be put back into the hands of the DnD community, as that is who I originally built the tool for.

### Developer vs. Company vs. Common Good

- *Developer:* **LGPL** Better for the developer who wants to use, for example, a library. They do not have to use the same license as the library if they only utilize the library, but if they are making modifications to the library and republishing then the license must stay the same, which benefits the original developer.

- *Company:* **Apache** The Apache license is best for a company because it restricts the use of a trademark.

- *Common Good:* **GPL** The GPL is best for the common good because every modification that is made must be redistributed using the same license. This means that any changes will remain under the GPL.

### Observatory Projects

| Project    	| License 	|
|------------	|---------	|
| Table Tome 	| MIT     	|
| AutoRoute  	| MIT     	|
| SharpNav   	| MIT     	|
| CloudBench 	| Apache  	|
| Suggestr   	| n/a    	|

### Project for this Course

I plan to continue a personal project of mine called Table Tome. The license on the project as of now is the MIT license, but I am thinking of changing the license to a copyleft license like the GPL. The customers are all Dungeons and Dragons players who are willing to use a laptop, tablet, or phone while playing the game to browse Table Tome. The DnD subreddit like the progress a while ago, so there will be a significant userbase if the development goes well. I am thinking about using a copyleft license mainly so that any improvements that are made are shared with the community that I was building the application for in the first case.
